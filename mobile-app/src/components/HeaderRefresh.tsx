/**
 * Re-read everything, by hand.
 *
 * Almost nothing in this app can go stale: there is no server, and every write invalidates
 * what it touched. The exception is creker, which lives in another app and is only read
 * when the checklist first mounts — so an hour of screen time racked up while this app sat
 * open in the background is invisible until you restart it. That is what this button is
 * really for; refetching the local caches on the way is free.
 *
 * It holds the "working" state for a moment even when the answer comes back instantly,
 * because a button that flickers and shows nothing reads as a button that does nothing.
