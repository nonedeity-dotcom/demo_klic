 * Making the phone ring when a focus phase runs out.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because one cannot cover both cases:
 *
 * - **App open.** JS is running, so the chosen file is played through expo-av and the
 *   phone vibrates. This is where a custom sound actually happens.
 * - **App backgrounded or screen off.** JS is suspended — the whole point of this timer is
 *   that the phone is face-down in another room — so nothing of ours can run at the
 *   deadline. A local notification is scheduled the moment the phase starts and cancelled
 *   if it is paused or reset. That one rings with its Android channel's sound, which the OS
 *   fixes at install time from a bundled resource: a file picked at runtime cannot be it.
 *
 * So a chosen sound is what you hear with the app in front of you, and the notification is
 * what reaches you when it isn't. Both vibrate.
